changeit(array,word)
print("after fun \n {} \n {}".format(array,word))

'''

ANS:  it is "pass by value" but all values are just references to objects.


Explaination:


[1, 2, 3, 4]
 singhal
after fun
 [1, 2, 3, 4]
 sumit


Output tells that:
whenever we are passing the immutable things in fun and trying to change it,
it creates a new instance and outside one will not change.

BUT

whenever we aee passing the mutable thing in fun and trying to change it , it will change on the same one, bcoz each and every thing is a object in python and mutable object are allowed to modify,
So outsidr one will also get change (as its pointing the same one)
